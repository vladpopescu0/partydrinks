- `drink_type`: TEXT (primary key, enum: 'Beer', 'Wine', 'Cocktail', 'Shot')
- `points`: INTEGER

### drinks

## Database Operations

All database operations are handled through utility functions in [lib/db.ts](mdc:lib/db.ts), including:

- Drink and win tracking
- Tweet creation
- Leaderboard retrieval

Storage operations are in [lib/storage.ts](mdc:lib/storage.ts) for file uploads.
